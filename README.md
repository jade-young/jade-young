### ‚ù¶ Bio
Hello! My name is Jade (she/her), and I am a PhD student at the University of Colorado on the Anschutz Medical Campus. Under the guidance of [Dr. Fan Zhang](https://fanzhanglab.org), I am working to analyze single-cell -omics data to understand auto-inflammatory disease progression and heterogeneity using machine learning and explainable AI methods. As a computational biologist, I am intrigued by the potential role of artificial intelligence in precision medicine. As an anthropologist, I am always seeking the human connection -- carefully acknowledging the social implications of the technologies. I would like to understand their impact on patient care and advocate for equitable, ethical use and access to these advancements. My journey has reinforced my belief in the power of curiosity and connection, guiding me as I strive to make a difference on the practical impact and delivery of healthcare for all.

When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you might find me learning about natural fabrics, wood carving, or making playlists üéß.
